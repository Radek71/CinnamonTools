## Quick Menu applet description

The function of this applet is very simple, create a menu based on the files/folders found inside a main folder (specified on this applet settings window). The files will be used to create menu items and the sub folders will be used to create sub-menus.

I mainly created this applet to replicate the functionality of the XFCE plugin called **Directory Menu** and the KDE widget called **Quick access**.

<h2 style="color:red;"> Warning</h2>
<span style="font-weight:bold; color:red;">
This applet has to read every single file/folder inside a main folder to create its menu. So, do not try to use this applet to create a menu based on a folder that contains thousands of files!!! Your system may slow down, freeze or even crash!!!
