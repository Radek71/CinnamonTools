**Important note:** Do not try to install and force compatibility for any other version of Cinnamon older than 2.8.6. As a protection mechanism, the extension will auto-disable itself.

## Features/Options
For detailed explanation of each option, see the **HELP.md** file inside this extension folder.

- **Applets/Desklets tweaks:** confirmation dialogs can be added to applet/desklet removal to avoid accidental removal. New items can be added to applets/desklets context menus (**Open applet/desklet folder** and **Edit applet/desklet main file**).
- **Notifications tweaks:** allows changing the notification popups to the bottom of the screen and change its top/bottom/right margins.
- **Window focus tweaks:** allows the activation of windows demanding attention with a keyboard shortcut or forced.
- **Hot corners tweaks:** allows to set a hover activation delay in milliseconds for each hot corner. This tweak is only available for Cinnamon versions lower than 3.2 (Cinnamon 3.2.x already has hot corners delay activation).
- **Tooltips tweaks:** allows to tweak the position and show delay of Cinnamon's UI tooltips. The position of the tooltip is only available for Cinnamon versions lower than 3.2 (Cinnamon 3.2.x already has the position of the tooltips changed).
- **Desktop tweaks:** Allows to drag applications from the menu or from the launchers applets into the desktop.
- **Popup menus tweaks:** Allows to change the behaviour of the applets menus.

<h2 style="color:red;"> Bug report and feature request</h2>
<span style="color:red;">
Spices comments system is absolutely useless to report bugs with any king of legibility. In addition, there is no notifications system for new comments. So, if anyone has bugs to report or a feature request, do so on this xlet GitHub page. Just click the **Website** button next to the **Download** button.
