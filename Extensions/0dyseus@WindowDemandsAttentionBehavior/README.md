## Window demands attention behavior description

This extension adds two different behaviors for windows that demand attention. It force them to be activated or a keyboard shortcut can be asigned to activate windows on demand.

## Based on
I found two Gnome Shell Extensions and I mixed their functions into one Cinnamon extension.

Spices comments system is absolutely useless to report bugs with any king of legibility. In addition, there is no notifications system for new comments. So, if anyone has bugs to report or a feature request, do so on this xlet GitHub page. Just click the **Website** button next to the **Download** button.
